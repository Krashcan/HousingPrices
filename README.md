## General Information
- This project was undertaken as Surprise Housing, a US-based housing company, plans to enter the Australian market.
- The aim is to predict the actual value of prospective properties in Australia, helping the company make informed investment decisions.
- The business problem addressed is the need for Surprise Housing to understand the factors affecting house prices in the Australian market to purchase properties below their actual values and flip them for a profit.
- The dataset used includes data on house sales in Australia, covering various factors such as location, size, condition, and other relevant property attributes.
- The objective is to build a regression model using regularization techniques to predict house prices and determine the significant variables influencing these prices.

## Conclusions
- Our analysis identified several significant predictors for the price of houses, including 1stFlrSF, OverallQual, and 2ndFlrSF.
- Both Ridge and Lasso regression models were utilized to enhance prediction accuracy and determine the key factors influencing house prices.
- The Ridge regression model achieved a test accuracy of 86.15%, while the Lasso regression model achieved a test accuracy of 85.65%.
